## Introduction

This repository is designed to provide a collection of Python practice exercises, organized by chapters and topics. It serves as a learning resource for both beginners and intermediate Python developers.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `BroCodeYt` - Contains exercises and examples from the BroCode YouTube channel.
- `chapter-1` - Exercises and notes for Chapter 1.
- `chapter-2` - Exercises and notes for Chapter 2.
- `Notes.txt` - General notes on Python programming.
- `chapters.txt` - Overview of chapters and their contents.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhishekS04/PythonPrac.git
   cd PythonPrac
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific chapter or exercise**:
   ```bash
   cd chapter-1
   ```

3. **Run the Python scripts**:
   ```bash
   python exercise1.py
   ```

## Usage

Each folder contains Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts and exercises. You can run these scripts to understand how different Python features work. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to enhance your learning experience.

## Enhancing Code Comments

To improve code readability and maintainability, use the **Better Comments** extension in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). This extension enables different comment styles, making it easier to categorize and highlight important notes.

### Installation Steps:

1. Open VSCode.
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for "Better Comments" by **Aaron Bond**.
4. Click "Install".

### Comment Categorization:

Use different symbols to categorize comments effectively:

- `// * Important comment`
- `// ! Warning or alert`
- `// ? Question or clarification`
- `// TODO: Task or reminder`

This system ensures better readability and organization of your code annotations.
